# Known bugs: 
# - Aces not working as intended. Points_system() will check if score > 11 but will convert all Aces to 1 if your first card was an ace - meaning 2 aces should be worth 12 but are worth 11.
# - Sometimes the player will win multiple times what they should, this happens after a win is succceeded by a double-down loss.
